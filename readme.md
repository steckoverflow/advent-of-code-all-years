# Advent of Code
# All years

## Why
Coding and attempting to solve for all goldstars in a less stressful and competitive environment, trying various tools, technologies and languages.

I probably wont come back to improve and make code look good. It's quick and dirty. I won't copy paste any code off the internet but rather solve it in the way my brain works.
Yours might work differently... (probably better)

If I struggle'd with something I add 🥵
